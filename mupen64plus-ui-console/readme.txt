HelloNativeSDK

========================================================================
Using a managed project vs. using a makefile project

 This package contains two different types of project options. One is an eclipse-based 
 managed project and the other is a makefile project. The managed project leverages 
 Eclipse to manage the build process so that you don’t have to worry about makefiles. 
 When using this option you can adjust build settings through the project properties. 
 The makefile project allows you to see and edit makefiles for direct control of the 
 build process.
